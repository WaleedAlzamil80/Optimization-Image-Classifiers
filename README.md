# Optimization Image Classifiers
This project is divided into two milestones. The first milestone involves comparing the performance of different optimization algorithms on different types of test functions. The second milestone involves creating and training a multilayer neural network to classify images into their corresponding categories.

 The results from the first milestone will be used to select the most effective optimization algorithm for training the neural network for the second milestone. The final goal is to achieve high accuracy in image classification using the selected algorithm and neural network architecture.

## Milestone 1:
Optimization algorithms play a crucial role in many fields of science and engineering, from machine learning and data science to operations research and control engineering. These algorithms are designed to find the optimal solution to a given problem by iteratively improving a candidate solution based on some objective function.

However, there are many different optimization algorithms, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some algorithms are better suited for certain types of problems than others, and some may converge faster or more reliably than others. Therefore, it is important to compare and evaluate different optimization algorithms on various types of test functions to determine which algorithm is best suited for a given problem.

In this milestone, we will address the problem of comparing different optimization algorithms on various types of test functions.
We will explore popular optimization algorithms

Additionally, we have experimented with some improvements to some of the previously stated algorithms in the following:
1. Bias correction
2. Learning rate decay
3. Line search algorithm
