The functions categories listed below are some of the common functions and datasets used for testing optimization algorithms. They are grouped according to similarities in their significant physical properties and shapes. We have selected exactly one function from each category, as shown below:



# Eggholder (Many Local Minima)

![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/egg.png)

The Eggholder function is extremely tricky to optimize, due to the presence of  large number of local minima.

# Trid (Bowl-Shaped)

![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/trid.png)

The Trid function has no local minimum except the global one. 

# Matyas (Plate-Shaped)

![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/matya.png)

The Matyas function has no local minima except the global one.

# Three-Hump Camel (Valley-Shaped)

![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://i.ibb.co/VvDZJMr/Untitled.png)

 The function has three local minima.


# Michalewicz (Steep Ridges/Drops)

![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/michal.png)

For a Michalewicz function of d-dimensions, it has d! local minima.


# Styblinski-Tang (Other)

![IMAGE_DESCRIPTION](https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/stybtang.png)

The Styblinski-Tang function has multiple local minima and global minima.
