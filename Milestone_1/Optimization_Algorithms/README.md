### Techniques used in optimization algorithms for improving the convergence and optimization performance of the algorithms.

* Decay learning rate refers to the process of gradually reducing the learning rate of an optimization algorithm over time. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size taken by the optimization algorithm during each iteration. A high learning rate can cause the optimization algorithm to overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate can cause the algorithm to converge too slowly or get stuck in a local minimum.

Decay learning rate is important because it helps the optimization algorithm to converge more effectively and efficiently. As the algorithm approaches the optimal solution, the steps taken by the algorithm should become smaller to avoid overshooting or oscillating around the optimal solution. By reducing the learning rate over time, the optimization algorithm can take smaller steps as it gets closer to the optimal solution, which can help it converge more smoothly and accurately.

* Line search is a technique used in optimization algorithms to find the optimal step size along a given search direction. In an optimization problem, we are often interested in finding the optimal values of a set of parameters that minimize or maximize an objective function. Optimization algorithms typically work by iteratively updating the parameter values in the direction that minimizes the objective function.

Line search is used to determine the optimal step size for each iteration of the optimization algorithm. Given a search direction, line search involves finding the step size that minimizes the objective function along that direction. This can be done using a one-dimensional optimization algorithm, such as binary search or golden section search.

The optimal step size found by line search is used to update the parameter values in the optimization algorithm. By using the optimal step size, we can ensure that the optimization algorithm converges faster and more accurately, leading to better model performance.
