# Optimization Image Classifiers
This project is divided into two milestones. The first milestone involves comparing the performance of different optimization algorithms on different types of test functions. The second milestone involves creating and training a multilayer neural network to classify images into their corresponding categories.

 The results from the first milestone will be used to select the most effective optimization algorithm for training the neural network for the second milestone. The final goal is to achieve high accuracy in image classification using the selected algorithm and neural network architecture.

## Milestone 1:
The problem we are addressing in this milestone is the comparison of different optimization algorithms on various types of test functions. Optimization algorithms are essential in the field of machine learning, as they are used to minimize the cost function of a model. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the best optimization algorithm for a specific problem.

### Methods and Algorithms:
We will compare the performance of the following optimization algorithms:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent
2. Gradient Descent with Momentum
3. Adagrad
4. Adadelta
5. Adam

Additionally, we have experimented with some improvements to some of the previously stated algorithms in the following:
1. Bias correction
2. Learning rate decay
3. Line search algorithm

## Milestone 2:
